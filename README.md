# Filler
### Goal:  
Create a player program to compete against other students on the Filler board. The principle is simple: two players take on each other on a board, and take turns placing the piece that the master of the game (supplied in the form of a Ruby executable) gives them, earning points. The game stops as soon as a piece can no longer be placed.  
  
#### How to run the program:  
`./filler_vm -p1 user1 -p2 user2 -v -f mapfile`  
Filler_vm is the Ruby exececutable that provides pieces, user1 and user2 are player executables and mapfile is any of the maps provided in the resources/maps directory.
